# üñ•Ô∏è IT Support SLA Tracker

A hands-on IT support project that simulates a real-world helpdesk environment. This tracker uses Python to automate SLA monitoring and Excel to visualize ticket trends and performance.

### üîß What it does
- Reads ticket data from a CSV
- Calculates how many days each ticket has been open
- Flags tickets that violate the SLA (open > 3 days)
- Outputs a list of overdue tickets
- Generates a clean Excel dashboard with pivot tables & charts to show:
  - Ticket priority breakdown
  - Technician workload
  - SLA performance (overdue vs on-time)

### üí° Why I built this
To practice real IT operations work ‚Äî including automation, data handling, and reporting ‚Äî while creating a project I can show on my resume and GitHub. It blends IT support concepts, scripting, and business analytics.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech used
- Python (pandas, datetime)
- Excel (pivot tables, conditional formatting)
- VS Code + terminal
